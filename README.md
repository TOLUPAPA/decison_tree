# Decision tree classifier for Kyphosis
This is a decision tree model used to detect whether a patient has kyphosis based on several parameters in the database.
Decision Trees are versatile Machine Learning algorithms that can perform both classification and regression tasks, and even multioutput tasks. 
They are very powerful algorithms, capable of fitting complex datasets.
Decision Trees are also the fundamental components of Random Forests which are among the most powerful machine learning algorithms available.
The best way to understand how they work is to look at an example where a decision tree will be used for classification.
